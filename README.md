# Frogger-Style Starter (Godot)

This repository is a **very minimal starter project** for a Frogger-style game built with **Godot**.

It contains **only**:
- a single main scene
- the visual assets used in the tutorial

Nothing more.

---

## What’s Included

- **`Main.tscn`**
  - A basic empty window

- **`/assets`**
  - sprites used in the tutorial
  - sound effects

This project is intentionally **barebones**.

---

## What’s NOT Included

- No gameplay logic  
- No movement code  
- No scoring system  
- No win / lose conditions  

All of that is built **during the tutorial**.

## A Note on Visuals

If something looks rough or unpolished — that’s on me, I am a terrible artist.

In one case, an asset from the excellent **Kenney** site was used:
